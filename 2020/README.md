# Advent of Code 2020

Here are my attempts. Mostly in Kotlin within Jupyter Notebook. Attempt your own solutions first before peeking.

All solutions avoid the use of any mutability. No `var` or mutable types (like `mutableList` or `mutableMap`)
are allowed whatsoever. I would rather spend more time on a problem than needed than give in to the sinful
temptation of not working with immutability.

Furthermore, while not fully achieved yet, usage of `print` and `println` should be avoided. All answers should
appear in the output of their cell implicitly.
