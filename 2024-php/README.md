# Advent of Code 2024 in PHP

My [Advent of Code][aoc] solutions for 2024
written in [PHP 8.4][php] with [Illuminate Collections][pic].

Solutions can be run using `aoc`.

```bash
php aoc run 1
```

This will run the solution for day 1 assuming `Day01.php` exists in solutions and `Day01.txt` in inputs.
